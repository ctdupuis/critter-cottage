# Critter Cottage - Original Project

## About

This is the original project repository for Critter Cottage used to pass my final assessment at Flatiron School. In order to deploy to Heroku, I had to initiate separate repositories for the [React/Redux client](https://github.com/ctdupuis/critter-cottage-client) and the [Rails API](https://github.com/ctdupuis/critter-cottage-api). This repository was kept in order to save all of my commit messages. All future commits can be found in the new repos.
