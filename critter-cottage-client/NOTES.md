animal has many species
species belongs to animal
images goes in app/assets/images => maybe make a route '/images' that renders these images, then pull their sources from that route in a fetch call and update it to the state for rendering

a user can adopt an animal, so a user has one or many animals?
maybe make crud functionality only for admin
